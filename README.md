The name **Wundorsmiþa geweorc**, literally *the work of wondersmiths* (variously translated by editors) is our tribute to the most popular composition in Old English, i.e. Beowulf.

This expression is contained in the first hemistichs of line 1681, and refers to the wonderful sword (or at least at the hilt remaind after the battle) thanks to which Beowulf defeats Grendel's mother, saving himself from the perils of the marsh.

In the same way, this repository aims to be a toolkit not to get mired in the marsh Old English resources, which hopefully will not "betray" you as Hrunting did with Beowulf.
